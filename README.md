# Physics-Racecar-Lab-Simulator
A simulator created for the purpose of a teaching tool for a high school Physics C Mechanics and Electromagnetism course. The application simulates a lab in which the  student learns about the three main vector quantities of movement in physics: displacement, velocity, and acceleration. The application asks for input regarding changes to velocity (as you would do in a real car), and simulates this change in both the game space and mathematical difference.

To play the game, download the 'PhysicsKart64 1.05.00.jar' file. Requires a Java Runtime Environment of 1.6+
